# Project: NewsAPI

## Description

In this app, I request news articles from newsapi.org and store those in the app with the Realm database platform. 
I practice the following topics:

* Conform to MVC
* Swift Package Manager(Realm, SDWemImage)
* Architecture: data driven approach with mock API
* Replace mock API, with real web request
* Parsing JSON
* Dependency Injection
* Querying, storing and retrieving data with Realm database
* Follow best practices
